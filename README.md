  This was the final project for my Computer Organization and Assembly Languange class. I programmed an Uno R3 to simulate two traffic lights facing opposite directions. The LEDs cycle from green to yellow to red and then repeat. Each color pair lights up for three seconds. There is one button which simulates a crosswalk button. When pressed, the normal light cycle will be interrupted when the lights turn red. A white LED will then turn on for three seconds, representing a crossing signal. When the white LED turns off, the traffic signals will resume normal operation.
